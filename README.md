# Genome-Wide-Association-Study-Expanded
An expansion on a GWAS previously conducted. The previous study looked at the genomic basis of sheep wool to determine what areas of the genome influence specific phenotypic traits such as wool length and diameter.

## Features
* Coarse Edge Micron: a measurement used to describe the diameter of fibers in a sample; useful for determining quality of fibers.
* Coefficient of Variation: a measure of the variation in fiber fineness within a sample of wool; useful for determining the distribution of wool fiber quality.
* Average Fiber Diameter: the average fiber diameter; useful for determining the properties of fibers and the applications it can be used in.
* Spinning Fineness: a calculation that estimates the micron size of yarn that can be produced from a sample of fibers; used to determine the best application of the wool.
* Staple Length: the length of a fiber; useful in a variety of areas such as yarn spinning as it aids in cohesion and twisting.

## Pipeline
1. Input a decade's worth of lambing records into spreadsheets.
2. Organize, clean, and filter lambing records.
3. Analyze the final dataframe.
